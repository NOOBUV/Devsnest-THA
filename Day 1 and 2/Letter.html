    <p> <b>Subject: Devsnest Codecamp </b></p>
    <p>Sir,</p>
    <p class="bodyofletter">I would like to conduct a codecamp in our college organised by <span class="Devsnest">Devsnest</span>. 
    The purpose of this codecamp will be to make students interview ready.
    <emp>Devsnest is a non-profit organisation which provides 1 month code camp,free of cost, to help students
     get their dream job.
    They also provide jobs and internships based on skills through their hiring partners and network.</emp>
    It is therefore important for students to have this opportunity.
    <br><br>
    This workshop will be beneficial for all the students and would help them to make connections as the course is based on peer-learning.
    The camp will start from 01.06.2021 and will end on 30.06.21.
